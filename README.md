# 👋 Howdy 🤠

### ✨ I'm Kyle, and I'm a DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure engineer ✨

💻 I do mostly work with high-performance systems and do backend development professionally, but I like to occasionally dabble in graphics, game, systems, or embedded programming on the side. 💽

😎 Pronouns are He/Him 😎

🌟 I sometimes stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/stackoverflo_) 📺
