# 👋 Howdy 🤠

### ✨ I'm Kyle, and I'm a Cloud Infrastructure engineer ✨

💻 I mostly work with cloud-based high-performance IT systems and do backend development professionally, but I like to occasionally dabble in graphics, game, web, or systems programming, or whatever random thing I feel like that day 💽

😎 Pronouns are He/Him 😎

🌟 I sometimes stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/stackoverflo_) 📺
